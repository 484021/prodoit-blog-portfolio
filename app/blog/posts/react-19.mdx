In our React 19 RC Upgrade Guide, we shared step-by-step instructions for upgrading your app to React 19. In this post, we’ll give an overview of the new features in React 19, and how you can adopt them.

## What&#39;s new in React 19

### Actions

A common use case in React apps is to perform a data mutation and then update state in response. For example, when a user submits a form to change their name, you will make an API request, and then handle the response. In the past, you would need to handle pending states, errors, optimistic updates, and sequential requests manually.

For example, you could handle the pending and error state in `useState`:

```js
// Before Actions
function UpdateName({}) {
  const [name, setName] = useState("");
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);
  const [isPending, setIsPending] = useState(false);

  const handleSubmit = async () => {
    setIsPending(true);
    const error = await updateName(name);
    setIsPending(false);
    if (error) {
      setError(error);
      return;
    }
    redirect("/path");
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input value={name} onChange={(event) => setName(event.target.value)} />
      <button onClick={handleSubmit} disabled={isPending}>
        Update
      </button>
      {error && <p>{error}</p>}
    </div>
  );
}
```

In React 19, we’re adding support for using async functions in transitions to handle pending states, errors, forms, and optimistic updates automatically.

For example, you can use `useTransition` to handle the pending state for you:

```js
// Using pending state from Actions
function UpdateName({}) {
  const [name, setName] = useState("");
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);
  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();

  const handleSubmit = () => {
    startTransition(async () => {
      const error = await updateName(name);
      if (error) {
        setError(error);
        return;
      }
      redirect("/path");
    });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input value={name} onChange={(event) => setName(event.target.value)} />
      <button onClick={handleSubmit} disabled={isPending}>
        Update
      </button>
      {error && <p>{error}</p>}
    </div>
  );
}
```

The async transition will immediately set the `isPending` state to true, make the async request(s), and switch `isPending` to false after any transitions. This allows you to keep the current UI responsive and interactive while the data is changing.

> ### Note
>
> By convention, functions that use async transitions are called “Actions”. Actions
> automatically manage submitting data for you:
>
> - Pending state: Actions provide a pending state that starts at the beginning of a request and automatically resets when the final state update is committed.
> - Optimistic updates: Actions support the new `useOptimistic` hook so you can show users instant feedback while the requests are submitting.
> - Error handling: Actions provide error handling so you can display Error Boundaries when a request fails, and revert optimistic updates to their original value automatically.
> - Forms: `<form>` elements now support passing functions to the `action` and `formAction` props. Passing functions to the `action` props use Actions by default and reset the form automatically after submission.

Building on top of Actions, React 19 introduces `useOptimistic` to manage optimistic updates, and a new hook `React.useActionState` to handle common cases for Actions. In react-dom we’re adding `<form>` `Actions` to manage forms automatically and `useFormStatus` to support the common cases for Actions in forms.

In React 19, the above example can be simplified to:

```js
// Using <form> Actions and useActionState
function ChangeName({ name, setName }) {
  const [error, submitAction, isPending] = useActionState(
    async (previousState, formData) => {
      const error = await updateName(formData.get("name"));
      if (error) {
        return error;
      }
      redirect("/path");
      return null;
    },
    null
  );

  return (
    <form action={submitAction}>
      <input type="text" name="name" />
      <button type="submit" disabled={isPending}>
        Update
      </button>
      {error && <p>{error}</p>}
    </form>
  );
}
```

In the next section, we’ll break down each of the new Action features in React 19.

## New hook: `useActionState`

To make the common cases easier for Actions, we’ve added a new hook called `useActionState`:

```js
const [error, submitAction, isPending] = useActionState(
  async (previousState, newName) => {
    const error = await updateName(newName);
    if (error) {
      // You can return any result of the action.
      // Here, we return only the error.
      return error;
    }

    // handle success
    return null;
  },
  null
);
```

`useActionState` accepts a function (the “Action”), and returns a wrapped Action to call. This works because Actions compose. When the wrapped Action is called, `useActionState` will return the last result of the Action as `data`, and the pending state of the Action as `pending`.

> ### Note

> `React.useActionState` was previously called `ReactDOM.useFormState` in the Canary
> releases, but we&#39;ve renamed it and deprecated `useFormState`.{" "}
